    <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Hi, it's Greg. On my previous job
      in transportation company I always wanted to have an application that will
      help me to manage the drivers and at the same time will help the drivers to
      be more organized in their job. That’s why I built this Transporter App. I
      built this app using Ruby on Rails back end and React.js front end. I also
      used Materialize framework for dynamic styling and parallax effect on the
      main page.</p>
    <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">My application allows the driver
      to log in and go to their private page. Driver will see only assigned to him
       or her clients thanks to internal API calls. The main feature is that the
       driver can only navigate to the next client and must confirm successful
       pickup and drop off of the client.  Only after confirmed pickup, the driver
        will see the client’s destination address. And after confirmed drop off
        the driver will get the next client’s pickup address. This system will
        eliminate possible mistakes and confusion in client’s pickup order.</p>
    <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">In Transporter, I’ve added the
      manager’s functionality, so that managers can see the list of all clients
      and can assign clients to the specific driver. Also, manager can see the
      current progress of each driver: which clients has been picked up, and
      which has not been picked up.</p>
    <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Additionally, I've successfully
      implemented Google Maps API so that a map with the trip is displayed on a
      client's show page.</p>
    <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">As a side feature, I added a new
      drivers application. So that new potential employees can easily find the
      information about current open positions and fill the job application.</p>
